datasync
========

This project demonstrates the capabilities of PubNub Datasync through an interactive demo in the form of a house. The house 
consists of

1. music player
2. door
3. garage door
4. lights

The devices in the house are controlled by embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. These devices can now talk to each other
through PubNub. Using DataSync, you can control these devices from anywhere in the world. You can switc on/off your lights,
turn on the music, and check whether your doors are locked or not. 
What's more, is that the state of these devices can also be stored into PubNub, and retrieved from anywhere, from any device.
